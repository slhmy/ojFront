This an example project to show how it work with the back-end [oniline_judge](https://github.com/slhmy/online_judge). I'm not so go at font-end programming, but ojFront looks ok for me. So enjoy it :beers: .

# How to connect back-end
I'm can't figure out how to get .env and get the url. So currently, I set the back-end url in `src\index.tsx`. If your backend is not `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, you will need to change it.
